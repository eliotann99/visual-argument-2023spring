For this project, I wanted to visually highlight how different choices can lead to different outcomes. Often times, people need to decide between focusing on
their career, or invest more time in other life valuables.

I used Adobe Photoshop to edit, layer, and merege photos together that I licensed through Adobe Stock.
All the images I have used so far were licensed through Adobe Stock.
