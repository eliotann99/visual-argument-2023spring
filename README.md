# "Family vs Career"

For this project, I wanted to visually highlight how different choices can lead to different outcomes. Often times, people are lead to decide between focusing on their career and focusing on their family.

I used Adobe Photoshop to edit, layer, and merege photos together that I licensed through Adobe Stock.

All the images I have used so far were licensed through Adobe Stock and here's a link to their license-terms. https://stock.adobe.com/license-terms
